My professional experience comprises research, consulting and teaching activities. 
After the degree in Civil Engineering in 2003, JNF worked in a private company in projects related to water management, dam safety and hydropower. 

In 2005, JNF joined the Water Resources and Hydraulic Structures Division of the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering ([LNEC](https://www.lnec.pt))as a research fellow working in several research and consulting projects related to flood management and hydropower production. In addition to the work at LNEC, JNF developed the PhD with a thesis in the field of fluvial hydraulics, flood management and interactions between flow and vegetation in rivers. 

Between 2012 and 2014, JNF joined Nova University Lisbon ([UNOVA](https://www.fct.unl.pt)) as Assistant Professor and responsible for the subjects related to Hydraulics and Urban Hydraulics. In August 2013, JNF was admitted as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Hydraulics and Environment of LNEC. In 2015 and 2016, JNF joined the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) as postdoctoral researcher. JNF participated in research projects related to hydropower production and transport and control of sediments. In 2017, JNF returned to LNEC where he is now Assistant Researcher. Since December 2019, JNF is also invited Assistant Professor at UNOVA. From this professional career resulted a total of more than 120 scientific and technical publications, including book chapters, journal papers, as well as communications to national and international congresses and an extensive production of technical reports.
