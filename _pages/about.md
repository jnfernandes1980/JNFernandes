My professional experience comprises research, consulting and teaching activities. 
After the degree in Civil Engineering in 2003, JNF worked in a private company in projects related to water management, dam safety and hydropower. 

In 2005, JNF joined the Water Resources and Hydraulic Structures Division of the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering ([LNEC](https://www.lnec.pt))as a research fellow working in several research and consulting projects related to flood management and hydropower production. In addition to the work at LNEC, JNF developed the PhD with a thesis in the field of fluvial hydraulics, flood management and interactions between flow and vegetation in rivers. 

Between 2012 and 2014, JNF joined Nova University Lisbon ([UNOVA](https://www.fct.unl.pt)) as Assistant Professor and responsible for the subjects related to Hydraulics and Urban Hydraulics. In August 2013, JNF was admitted as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Hydraulics and Environment of LNEC. In 2015 and 2016, JNF joined the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) as postdoctoral researcher. JNF participated in research projects related to hydropower production and transport and control of sediments. In 2017, JNF returned to LNEC where he is now Assistant Researcher. Since December 2019, JNF is also invited Assistant Professor at UNOVA. From this professional career resulted a total of more than 120 scientific and technical publications, including book chapters, journal papers, as well as communications to national and international congresses and an extensive production of technical reports.

I am working on (https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You 
Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and
